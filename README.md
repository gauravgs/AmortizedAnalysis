*Amortized analysis is a method of analyzing the costs associated with a data structure that averages the worst operations out over time. Often, a data structure has one particularly costly operation, but it doesn't get performed very often. That data structure shouldn't be labeled a costly structure just because that one operation, that is seldom performed, is costly.*
## There are three types of amortized analysis: 
### <li> aggregate analysis :</li>
    Averaging the time complexity.
### <li> accounting method :</li>
    Credit - Debit.
### <li> potential method :</li>
    Work done is proprtional to the Potential Energy.
